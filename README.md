Facebook-style chat using basic web dev tools (React, Node.JS, Socket.IO).
The chat allows users to register and exchange messages. Unlike most React-based chat apps, this keeps a separate "namespace" for each conversation which is generated by a combination of the two user IDs. This little trick allows for more advanced functions like logging (including batching old convos), offline messages, etc.
